*Wealth of Nations* vol. 1: The text of Smith starts on line 515 of the HTML file.

Next steps:

1. Scroll through `WoN_1.html`, starting at line 515, and see what marked-up content is there. We know:
  - marginal notes
  - footnotes and their references
  - page-break stuff
1. See where the footnotes (themselves) start. Are they all at the end of the file?
1. We will pull out into a separate file the Adam Smith part of that file, for further processing.
