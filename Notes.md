## Misc.

*Wealth of Nations* vol. 1: The text of Smith starts on line 515 of the HTML file.

Next steps:

1. Scroll through `WoN_1.html`, starting at line 515, and see what marked-up content is there. We know:
  - marginal notes
  - footnotes and their references
  - page-break stuff
1. See where the footnotes (themselves) start. Are they all at the end of the file?
1. We will pull out into a separate file the Adam Smith part of that file, for further processing.

## Tasks

- Citation of Volumes, Books, Paragraphs
- Capturing pagination index
- Capturing marginal summaries as an "Analytical Exemplar"
- Footnotes as a commentary
- Footnotes aligned with paragraph-level citation scheme
- Tokenization and Tokenized Analytical Edition
- Footnotes aligned to tokenized edition
- Translation of page-references in notes to URN references
- Numbers to decimals universally? (exemplar?)

## Data for Testing

- Vol 1 starts at l.515
- Vol 2 start at l.325
- Use the TOC to validate sections
- Confirm that number of footnotes == number of refs
- Confirm that number of footnotes extracted == number of footnotes
- Confirm that number of footnote refs extracted == number of footnotes
- Confirm number of pages in original edition



## Concepts

- Separation of Concerns
- Citation
- Transformations:
  - Basic find/replace
  - Regular Expressions (supercharged find/replace)
  - Scripting
